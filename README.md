# Personal Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This site showcases my data science and software engineering projects, as well as workshop resources.

## 🗂️ Projects
### Data Science Projects
- Four diverse projects demonstrating skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
- Includes visualizations from R and Python.

### Software Engineering Projects
- Three full-stack / frontend-focused projects built with React and modern web development tools.
- Highlights clean, modular code, responsive layouts, and best practices.

### Workshop Resources
- Public clips and materials available on a dedicated resources page.
- Password-protected pages for lab-specific materials, with front-end access control.
- Dropbox stores recordings and slides — each lab page only exposes its own resources.

## 🌟 Features
- Image carousel for project media
- Embedded Google Docs resume
- Smooth parallax scrolling for depth and engagement
- Animated transitions with Framer Motion
- On-scroll reveal animations using useInView
- Clean, minimal styling with modular CSS

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Vite, React, React Router, CSS Modules
- **Styling:** Native CSS with modular, reusable components
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages with CI/CD via GitHub Actions (custom domain: pearlynne.dev)
- **Backend / Auth (optional):** Firebase for secrets injection and future features
- **Resource Security:** Environment variables for passwords to protect lab-specific pages, without exposing Dropbox links

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Enhanced animations and interactivity for project pages
- Secure video hosting with password-protected access for future workshop resources
- Possibly integrate Firebase or another backend for dynamic resource access

## ✅ Notes / Tips
- Password-protected resource pages only reveal links for the corresponding workshops
- Modular CSS ensures styles are isolated and reusable across pages
